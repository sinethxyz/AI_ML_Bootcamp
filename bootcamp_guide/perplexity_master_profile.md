- Physical space dedicated to deep work
- Minimal distractions during sessions

**Optimize For:**
- Complex algorithm implementations
- Research paper reading marathons
- Building complete projects in one session
- Debugging difficult issues
- Learning new frameworks intensively

### Attention Management

**Challenges:**
- Difficulty with boring/repetitive tasks
- Mental fatigue from context switching
- Forgetting tasks if not immediately executed
- Getting stuck in interesting tangents

**Compensatory Strategies:**
- Automate repetitive tasks immediately
- Batch similar tasks together
- External brain: note-taking system
- "Parking lot" for interesting tangents
- Clear next-action always defined

**Tools:**
- Notion/Obsidian for second brain
- GitHub for version control (never lose work)
- Pomodoro for sustained focus
- Physical notebook for immediate capture
- Calendar blocks for structure

### Dopamine Optimization

**What Works:**
- Immediate feedback (tests passing, code running)
- Visible progress (GitHub contributions, metrics)
- Public accountability (Twitter, blog)
- Competition (Kaggle leaderboards)
- Novel challenges (new problems, not repetition)

**Implementation:**
- Ship something every day (dopamine hit)
- Track metrics visibly (dashboard)
- Share progress publicly (social pressure)
- Set short-term milestones (weekly wins)
- Variety in projects (avoid boredom)

### Context Switching Protocols

**When Stuck:**
1. Time-box debugging (30 min max)
2. Switch to different subproblem
3. Take physical break (walk, exercise)
4. Return with fresh perspective
5. Or move to entirely different project

**When Bored:**
1. Acknowledge diminishing returns
2. Ship current version (even if imperfect)
3. Switch to more interesting problem
4. Return later if needed

**When Overwhelmed:**
1. Break into smallest possible tasks
2. Complete one tiny task
3. Celebrate small win
4. Build momentum with next small task

## LEARNING STYLE OPTIMIZATION

### Pattern-First Learning (Not Memorization)

**Approach:**
1. Identify underlying pattern/framework
2. Understand why pattern exists
3. See pattern in multiple contexts
4. Apply pattern to new problems
5. Internalize through usage (not memorization)

**Example - Learning ML Algorithms:**
- ❌ Memorize equations for each algorithm
- ✅ Recognize pattern: "All ML = optimize loss function via gradient descent"
- ✅ See variations: Different losses, different optimizers, different regularization
- ✅ Apply: When to use which variation based on problem structure

**Implementation:**
- Always ask "What's the pattern here?"
- Build pattern libraries
- Map new concepts to existing patterns
- Create visual frameworks
- Test understanding by explaining pattern

### Build-First Learning (Not Theory-First)

**Approach:**
1. Build something (even if broken)
2. Encounter problems
3. Learn theory to solve problems (just-in-time)
4. Apply immediately
5. Iterate and improve

**Example - Learning Neural Networks:**
- ❌ Read textbook chapters, then build
- ✅ Try to build neural network, fail, learn why, fix, iterate
- ✅ Learn backprop when you need to implement it
- ✅ Learn optimization when training doesn't converge
- ✅ Learn regularization when overfitting occurs

**Implementation:**
- Start with end goal (working project)
- Build minimal version quickly
- Learn concepts as they become necessary
- Apply learning immediately to project
- Theory makes sense in context

### Multi-Modal Learning

**Combines:**
- Reading (documentation, papers)
- Watching (selective videos for complex topics)
- Coding (primary learning mode)
- Teaching (writing blog posts)
- Discussing (communities, forums)

**Optimal Mix:**
- 10% Reading about concepts
- 5% Watching tutorials (only for hard-to-grasp topics)
- 70% Building and coding
- 10% Writing about what you learned
- 5% Discussing with others
