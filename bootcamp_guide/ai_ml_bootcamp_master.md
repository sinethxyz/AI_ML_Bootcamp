## The Truth About Mastery

**It's hard. Really hard.**

Most people:
- Give up after 2 weeks
- Stay in tutorial hell forever
- Never ship real projects
- Don't put in 1000 hours

**You will:**
- Feel stupid often (that's learning)
- Hit plateaus (keep pushing)
- Want to quit (don't)
- Doubt yourself (normal)

**But you have unfair advantages:**
- Your brain sees patterns others miss
- You can hyperfocus for hours
- You think systematically
- You learn from first principles

**1000 hours of deliberate practice = mastery**
**Most people never put in 100 hours**
**You will.**
