## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Responses Don't Match Format

**Solution:**
1. Check Space Settings - is full instruction text there?
2. Re-copy from **03-SPACE-SETTINGS-INSTRUCTIONS.md**
3. Verify all files uploaded successfully
4. Try: "Format this response according to space instructions"

---

### Issue: Too Much/Little Detail

**Solution:** Specify explicitly:

```
[Your question]

DETAIL LEVEL:
- Depth: [High-level overview / Detailed implementation / Complete deep dive]
- Code: [Pseudocode / Working examples / Production-ready]
- Math: [Intuition only / With equations / Full derivations]
```

---

### Issue: Not Optimized for ADHD/Autism

**Solution:** Add to query:

```
[Your question]

CRITICAL OPTIMIZATIONS:
- ADHD: Need visual breaks every 300 words, clear milestones, weekly shipping goals
- Autism: Need explicit rules ("Always X when Y"), no ambiguous language, complete coverage
- Pattern: Start with pattern identification always
```
